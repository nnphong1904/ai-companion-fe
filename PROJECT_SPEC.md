- Optimized for both mobile and desktop
- Focus on product depth and feature creativity
- Clean architecture and scalability

The goal is to evaluate:

- Product-level thinking

- Code quality
- Clean separation between frontend and backend
- Creativity in custom features

---

# 2️⃣ Technical Requirements

## Frontend

- NextJS (App Router)
- TypeScript expected
- Mobile + Desktop optimized
- Clean UI component separation

## Backend

- Go
- REST API
- Clean separation of handlers / services / repositories

## Database

- Any (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Must justify choice in README
- Proper indexing required

## Storage

- Any cloud storage solution
- Used for images/videos

## Deployment

- Vercel (frontend) or equivalent
- Backend hosted and live
- Public link required

---

# 3️⃣ Asset Requirements (Very Important)

- Minimum 5 companions
- Each companion must have:
  - At least 1 photo OR video
  - At least 1 Story
- At least one Story must contain 4 slides
- Stories must include BOTH photos and videos
- Avoid generic stock images
- Assets must feel believable and emotionally aligned
- 9:16 vertical format for Stories

---

# 4️⃣ Core App Concept

This is NOT a chatbot.

It is a **Reactive AI Companion Social App** where:

- AI companions post Stories
- They react emotionally to user behavior
- Relationship evolves over time
- Important emotional moments are stored and resurfaced

The app must create a “Social Loop” that increases daily engagement.

---

# 5️⃣ Required Base Feature

## Stories System

- Horizontal story feed
- Full-screen story modal
- Animated progress bars
- Tap left/right navigation
- React buttons (❤️ 😢 😍 😡)
- Preloaded media
- At least one 4-slide story sequence

---

# 6️⃣ Feature Complete Item #1

## Dynamic Mood & Relationship System

### Purpose

Make companions emotionally reactive.

### Includes

- mood_score (numeric)
- relationship_score (numeric)
- Mood labels:
  - <20 → Distant
  - 20–50 → Neutral
  - 50–80 → Happy
  - 80+ → Attached
- Relationship progression display
- Mood changes based on:
  - Chat interactions
  - Story reactions
  - Time decay (inactivity reduces mood)

### Backend Model

RelationshipState:

- user_id
- companion_id
- mood_score
- relationship_score
- last_interaction
- updated_at

Composite unique index on:
(user_id, companion_id)

Mood recalculated on read (no background jobs).

This is a feature-complete system:

- Dedicated UI
- Backend logic
- Affects whole product experience

---

# 7️⃣ Feature Complete Item #2

## Emotional Memory Timeline

### Purpose

Provide emotional continuity.

This is NOT chat history.
It is curated meaningful shared moments.

### Includes

- Dedicated Memory page
- Timeline UI
- Memory card:
  - content
  - date
  - optional tag
- "Mark as Memory" action in chat
- Delete memory
- Optional pin feature

### Backend Model

Memories:

- id
- user_id
- companion_id
- content
- tag (optional)
- created_at

### Optional Resurfacing

When fetching Stories:
If memory older than X days exists,
Insert dynamic slide:

"I was thinking about when you said..."

No complex AI logic required.

This qualifies as a feature-complete system because:

- Own UI
- Own data model
- Own interaction logic
- Provides independent user value

---

# 8️⃣ Authentication (Expected but Not Counted as Feature)
